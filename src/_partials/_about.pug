        **I'm a product designer that helps sketch, prototype, and design digital solutions, product experiences, and visual assets.**
        
        I currently reside in Tampa,FL, where I help build a problem-solving platform for payments @ [Chargebacks911](https://chargebacks911.com)  
        
        Iâ€™m driven to learn why people do what they do so I can create experiences that are intuitive and successful. Iâ€™ve helped rethink, prototype and design solutions to help bring empathy and simplicty into complex problems - *which is a fancier way of saying I help things make sense*.
        
        If you'd like to learn more about my experience or challenge me to a few laps in Gran Turismo ðŸ•¹, [view my rÃ©sumÃ©](../resume/), or [get in touch](mailto:parag.ryan@gmail.com).
        
        PS. Ever since the Arizona Beverage Company decided that [Arizona Black & White Iced Tead](https://www.drinkarizona.com/product/black-white-tea), a.k.a. the nectar of the gods, was too expensive to produce and distribute to every one of their vendors, I've been on the hunt for a can of this not-so-sweet tea blend made by those professional alchemists/wizards. If you ever spot the a can, please let me know.
