        **I'm a product designer that helps sketch, prototype, and design digital solutions, product experiences, and visual assets.**
        
        I currently reside in Tampa,FL, where I help build a problem-solving platform for payments @ [Chargebacks911](https://chargebacks911.com)  

        Iâ€™m driven to learn why people do what they do so I can create experiences that are intuitive and successful. Iâ€™ve helped rethink, prototype and design solutions to help bring empathy and simplicty into complex problems - *which is a fancier way of saying I help things make sense*.
        
        I believe designing good products happens all the way from inception to building - user stories, naming variables, code style, architecture, copywriting, visuals. I believe everything should matter in the product design process.

        If you'd like to learn more about my experience or challenge me to a few laps in Gran Turismo ðŸ•¹, [view my rÃ©sumÃ©](../resume/), or [get in touch](mailto:parag.ryan@gmail.com).
