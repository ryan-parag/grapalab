        **I'm a product designer interested in building experiences that are logical, thoughtful, and accessible.**
        
        I currently reside in Tampa,FL, where I help simplify the home remodeling experience at [Masonite](https://masonite.com). Previously, I helped build a problem-solving platform for payments at [Chargebacks911](https://chargebacks911.com)  

        I‚Äôm driven to learn why people do what they do so I can create experiences that are intuitive and successful. I‚Äôve helped rethink, prototype and design solutions to help bring empathy and simplicty into complex problems - which is a fancier way of saying I help things make sense.
        
        If you'd like to see more of what I've been working on, take a look at my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ryanparag), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/ryanparag), [Github](https://github.com/ryan-parag), and [Behance](https://behance.net/grapa). For a more in-depth look at my design process, [let's chat](mailto:parag.ryan@gmai.com).

      p As a documentation nerd, I thought it would not only be fun to showcase the assets that help make this portfolio possible, but also be helpful to do a design inventory and build more efficient design patterns.

          p Like any designer, my portfolio is really never finished and is in a constant state of having the code reworked. I put together this portfolio using Pug (HTML), SCSS (CSS), a little bit of Javascript, and help from the following front-end resources:

            li
              a.link(target="_blank" href="http://bemskel.com/") BEM-flavored Grid and SCSS architecture from BEMSkel

        ##### How can I help?

        If you have a dope side project idea or want to trade project/portfolio feedback, I'd love to help out in any way I can. I probably won't always have answers, but I think I can be a helpful listener to bounce questions back and forth. If you have other design questions, that‚Äôs fine too!

        If you're in the Tampa Bay area, I'd love to chat over coffee, tea, seltzer water, coke zero, whatever really ‚òïÔ∏è &mdash; [let's chat](mailto:parag.ryan@gmail.com)!

        If I don't reply right away, please follow up ‚Äì sometimes things slip through the cracks! But I'll do my best to reply quickly.
