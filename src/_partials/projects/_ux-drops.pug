          ##### About the Site
          Some awesome folks over at **[Tampa Bay UX](https://twitter.com/tampabayux)** created a running list of UX resources to help designers, researchers, or anyone else learn more about the world of UX.
          They compiled a shared list in a Google Doc - but I thought this would work great in a friendlier, more visual form.

          ##### Framework
          Some of the primary goals behind the technical aspects of this catalog were:
          - lightweight and fast
          - Easily modifiable without having to touch any code
          
          Instead of having new posts generated by a new `markdown` file, I thought it would be neat to utilize the Google Sheets API so that other members of the community can simply modify a row in a Google Sheet and upload and image to Google Drive, thus creating a new post in the respective categpry of the Google Sheet.
          
          I also added a Typeform link for any thoughtful readers to submit a new resource that's currently not on the website.
          
          UX Drops was designed using HTML (PUG ðŸ’œ), CSS (SCSS), and Javascript. I'm using ðŸŒ¡ Jekyll to compile the site's markdown content into a static site. This is the first time I've used Jekyll and the Google Sheets API, so I'm still learning it and working through a few issues.
          
          ##### Next Steps
          While stille working through some kinks, there are a few more things I thought would be useful:
          - Adding a search filter within each page category
          - Add overlapping category badges for quick filtering
          - Port over to Netlify CMS for easier editing
