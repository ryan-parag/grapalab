          Although I juggled between a role as the designer on the marketing team and the sole designer on our application development team (30+ team members), it came as a blessing in disguise - it allowed me to see exacly how we could reach companies who needed a profit-optimizing solution, and how we could develop a solution to do just that. While at Chargebacks911, [**I was also chosen to join a small team to develop a dispute management application for enterprise banks. Check it out!**](../disputelab)

          h5.u-text-green What is a chargeback? 
          p It's difficult to explain how the entire process works, and if I tried to explain the entire thing on here, it would probably bore you to death - but when customers file a chargeback with their card issuer, this means that they are disputing a charge and request the card issuer for a refund.
          p 
            strong A chargeback is a transaction that a card issuer returns to an acquirer as a financial liability and which, in turn, an acquirer may return to the merchant. 
            | There are three common reasons for chargeback including fraud, processing errors, other disputes (e.g. customer disputes). The card schemes define the chargeback process, rules and regulations.

            ##### Research
            I was Designer #1 when I joined Chargebacks911 and it seemed as if design and product requirements were driven only by the business and client needs. Years of this process resulted in a broken user experience. After jumping into this process head first, I realized we needed to build a UX foundation that was rooted in user research, collaboration, and iterative prototyping.
            
            In order to understand the purpose of each of our solutions, I had to understand our internal methods, as well as the overall payments process - specifically credit card disputes. I jumped into a world rife with corporate acronyms, business rules, and convoluted logic.

            One of the largest areas creating bottlenecks in our internal process was the gathering of client data and creating an account on behalf of the client. Our teams would go through rounds of back and forth with clients asking for third-party login credentials, retailer information, types of products sold, etc. **We simply needed to rethink this entire process**.

            ##### Wizard and Merchant Application
            **Many retailers simply write-off falsely-protested charges as a cost of doing business.** Even if they do try and show evidence, they may still find themselves asking:
            - **Why is the chargeback process so complicated?**
            - **How can I automate these repetitive tasks?**
            - **How can I manage the disputes my financial team is handling?**
            
            Creating chargeback cases cost retailers and merchants millions of dollars in time - so we created an application that would give them the ability to make that process easier and reduce their time spent. By using the client's aggregated data, we can build cases using retailer and transaction information. After seeing our support teams' experience in manually inputting complex client information for setup, we realized we can gather more accurate data more easily by letting the client onboard themselves - thus came the onboarding wizard. Using a lightweight, step-by-step application, clients can choose from 1 of 3 service levels, the most in-depth of which would take all of the leg work away for them.

            ###### Gathering important data
            In order to build the most beneficial cases for disputes, we needed to connect to the client's transaction resources (eg. CRM, processor, bank, etc.) as well as intelligently categorize the products they sold.

            ###### Efficient sorting and filtering
            Many clients face a tsunami of transactions - so we began conducting user research and planning what we could deliver in the necessary timeline. Based on our findings, we architected a rule engine that could filter, sort, and flag through transactions to save time spent on manually searching.

            As part of the onboarding wizard, I created visual assets and a lightweight icon set to help illustrate selections and actions. I also included assets to help convey empty states, success states, product tiers, etc. Since we built the onboarding wizard to be white-labeled and themed for third-party partners, we made sure the visuals could be themed by utilizing the partner's brand palette.

            - **Password notifications**
            - **Upgrade prompts, etc.**
            
            By using [Ted Goas' Cerberus](https://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/), we made sure all of our email notifications would work on every type of email client (Gmail, Outlook, Mail app, etc.).

            After creating an account through the onboarding wizard, clients can begin managing their chargebacks and uploading their documents through the merchant portal. The merchant portal also gives users the ability to manage mutliple users, case reporting analytics, and fraudulent transaction alerts.
            
            Speaking with the support teams, we identified questions that often came up for new and old users, isolating pain points and assembling a timeline for what users experience as they progress through the app.
            - **Where were users leaving?** 
            - **What elements of the interface were confusing or unclear?**
            - **Were there any patterns that seemed too complex for the already complex process of payments?**

            After joining Chargebacks911, I saw there wasn't a source of truth nor standardization for the brand's design language. To help instill the brand's mission, vision, and values through a codified form, we created a style guide using our newly created styles. With an organized reference guide, we could onboard other teams, partners, vendors, and third parties to our brand design language quickly and more thoroughly. **I also happen to be a huge nerd for design documentation**.

          h5 Email Signature Generator
          p In my refactor of the company's email signature, we also needed to have working, custom signatures for the sales team. I quickly realized how timely and repetitive of a process it was to code custom signatures for sales team members manually. In a bit of my free time, I decided to create a small a Vue JS app that would help members of the sales team create their own Hubspot email signature.

          p After seeing the increase in efficiency and consistency in creating new email signatures for onboarded team members, it was time to tackle the other formats for which their email signatures may be used.
          p We needed to outline a few goals for a version 2 of the signature generator:
          ul
            li Add optional fields (e.g. Skype, Mobile, etc.) thay be be customized and toggled
            li Build and test signature for Chrome, Outllok, and the plethora of email clients
            li Build a more fluid, simple UI that provides better clarity in generating a signature
          p Since this was a simple front-end application, I thought using Vue, jQuery, and any other heavy, third-party JS libraries may be unnecessary for such a simple project. Therefore, I opted to use simple, modern JavaScript to build out the interactivity of the signature generator

            We use an internal web application to manage merchant accounts, clients, and their user permissions. As the oldest application of the company, and one that houses a complex portion of the payments process, we thought we could make the user processes easier and refactor the UI's framework by:
            1. Strengthening visual hierarchy and clarifying the navigation, including designing a new icon set that is extensible and legible at small sizes
            2. Reduce and eliminate inconsistencies by establishing conventions for how pages should be laid out, how buttons should be colored and positioned depending on their purpose, and how copy should be written
            3. Finding and implementing a more appropriate interface font that prioritized load speed and legibility at smaller sizes
            4. Cleaning up and organizing the CSS, establishing and enforcing naming rules in order to help maintain consistency, reduce technical debt, and simplify future changes

            ##### Website Design and Blog
            To help solidify our product offerings and expertise, as well as organize our content through a linear site architecture, we needed to redesign the main website. While undergoing a redesign, we also needed to standardize our website components (buttons, typography, navigation menus, links, etc.). Our goal for a website redesign, similar to many other companies' website redesign goal, is to direct more traffic in hopes to ultimately find readers who would benefit from our platform. After redesigning the website and creating a greater amount of interactive content (blog posts, webinars, ebooks), we gathered higher conversion rates, more traffic, and a greater number of qualified sales leads:

            ##### Repsonsive Infographics
            Part of the content marketing strategy was to employ the use of infographics - the point being for others to share the infographic to gain content traction. We thought that we can make that easier and device-friendly by using The New York Times' [Adobe Illustrator plugin](http://ai2html.org/) that would render the artbooards into multiple splices of HTML for specific breakpoints. We would then host the single HTML file and use our own custom JavaScript plugin to embed the infographics with a **single line of code**.

            ##### Marketing Design Assets
            Some of my time was spent redesigning all of our marketing assets per our newly-documented visual styles. Those responsibilities consisted of redesigning our tradeshow booths, flyers, banner ads, pitch decks, etc. Due to our increased marketing traction, we began seeing it was getting difficult to keep up with the items that needed to go out the door and the time we had on hand. In order to keep up with the scale of our marketing presence, we began creating templates and guides for some of our marketing items (eg. pitch decks, booklets, flyers) - which in turn gave other team members the ability to create an asset they needed without having to worry about designing it.

            ##### Landing Pages and Emails
            With the increase in the amount of new content being created from our writing and marketing teams, we saw the need to build landing page/email templates rather than build each page from scratch each time. Using HubSpot's templating language, HUBL, we were able to create a wide array of templates for newsletters, landing pages, and notifications - in turn **helping us increase the speed at which we could deliver content to our audiences**.
